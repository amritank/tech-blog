Instead of writing raw SQL queries, developers can manipulate database records as if they were objects in their programming language. ORMs automatically handle the translation between the objects in the application and the rows in the database, simplifying database operations and making code more maintainable and easier to understand. Examples of ORMs include Sequelize for Node.js and Hibernate for Java.",
